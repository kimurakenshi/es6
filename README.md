# ES6 Fundamentals

New features added in ES6 based on the book written by Nicholas Zakas [Understanding ECMAScript 6

## Block Bindings

### Block-Level Declarations

Block-level declarations are those that declare variables that are inaccessible outside of a given block scope. Block 
scopes are created:

- Inside of a function
- Inside of a block (indicated by the { and } characters)

#### Let Declarations

The let declaration syntax is the same as the syntax for var. You can basically replace var with let to declare a 
variable, but limit the variable’s scope to only the current code block. Since let declarations are not hoisted to the 
top of the enclosing block, you may want to always place let declarations first in the block, so that they are available
to the entire block.
This version of the `getValue` function behaves much closer to what you’d expect in other C-based languages. 
The variable value is declared using let instead of var. That means the declaration is not hoisted to the top of the 
function definition, and the variable value is destroyed once execution has flowed out of the if block. If condition 
evaluates to false, then value is never declared or initialized.
